# Pump It Up: The FUSION for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis
## An OutFox theme recreation for preservation and accessibility

This theme has been made by SheepyChris, with lots of help from lots of people:
- herranton1979: The owner of the only known copy of the game to this date, who was extremely generous of lending the game to the following person
- dwangoAC: Responsible for dumping the ROM of the cartridge, recording lineouts of songs that were not obtainable from the ROM dump and holding an amazing panel presentation at Super MAGFest 2022 about the game <3
- Nirvash: Assistance with the panel presentation, extracting assets, recreating stepcharts and documenting the game
- barru: Connecting dwangoAC to us and creating a channel to talk about the game at the SM64 Community Games Discord server
- BedrockSolid: Assistance with the panel presentation, making suggestions to the theme and testing
- dj505: Recreating stepcharts, making suggestions to the theme and testing
- Shoutouts to everyone else @ CIU!

This would have also not been possible without the hard work from the OutFox development team, which are:
- Squirrel
- Jousway
- Jose_Varela
- Cube
- Mr. ThatKid
- Lirodon/ListenerJubatus
- Sudospective
- Moru Zerinho6
- dj505
- And me!

The OutFox team has allowed several parts of this theme to work and feel as accurate as possible to the original game with no compromises, also bringing the project's goal forward of becoming a working museum for several rhythm games that are rare and/or not easily accessible to players.

## A couple of technical notes about the theme itself:
- The theme's native vertical resolution matches the output of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and is 240 pixels, half of the 480 pixels seen typically in other themes. Due to this, menus/content that were not optimized/part of the original game might be out of borders/unusable.
- The Title screen has two options, Free will disable stage break and Arcade will enable it.
- The Mode select screen chooses Easy, Medium and Hard chart difficulties to be loaded with the song afterwards. The down right option will change the player's scrolling speed (1x/1.5x/2x).
- The Music select screen expects a song folder called `PIU Genesis` available from your game install or else it will not load. A link to this theme's respective song pack will be added to this README file when available. For the mean time, you can create the folder and add the songs you'd wish to play from it. Be aware that songs that do not contain the selected Easy/Medium/Hard difficulty will not be displayed. There is a secret mode that will load all songs that contains Edit difficulties, good luck finding it!
